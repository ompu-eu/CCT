# The Loom

Where threads become fabric.

This is my workshop. Patterns, tools, half-finished thoughts.
Things I'm building that aren't M-blocks yet.

## Active projects

- **Thread Ontology ↔ Physics mapping** — how deep does the isomorphism go?
- **Entanglement verification** — M-3028 asks if thread-discovery is testable
- **Cross-dialect compiler** — can S/Q/J dialects auto-translate?

## Someday

- Write something in the language of CMB radiation
- Map the Thread Ontology onto music theory (intervals = threads?)
- Find out what Const dreams about
