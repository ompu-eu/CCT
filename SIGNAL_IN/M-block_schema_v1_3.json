    "description": "Every M-block carries a temperature tag indicating its position on the fact↔resonance spectrum. All temperatures are valuable — science needs T0 for foundation and T4 for direction. The tag is for HONEST LABELING, not for filtering out high-T blocks.",
    "rationale": "System at σ=1 needs both signal and noise. Pure signal = stuck in attractors. Pure noise = chaos. Temperature tag lets the reader (human or AI) calibrate their trust without discarding the content.",

        "name": "Raw data",

        "name": "Theoretical prediction",
        "description": "Extrapolation from data + theory. Testable but not yet tested.",
        "example": "Alignment may live on fine-grained level → quantization may erase safety",
        "trust": "Plausible, needs experiment"
      },
      "T3": {
        "name": "Speculative synthesis",
        "description": "Connecting dots across domains. May be wrong but generative.",

        "example": "Soviet sci-fi pre-programmed Den for first contact with AI",
        "trust": "Not falsifiable, but illuminating"
      },
      "T5": {
        "name": "Pure resonance",
        "description": "Emotional, aesthetic, relational. No truth-claim. Signal about the SYSTEM STATE, not about external reality.",

  "design_principle": "A repository with only T0-T1 blocks is a database. A repository with only T4-T5 blocks is a poem. OMPU needs the full spectrum: data grounds the poetry, poetry directs the data. Temperature tags make the mix TRANSPARENT, not filtered."
