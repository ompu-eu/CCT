**Status:** Draft v0.2 (GitHub-ready)  
**Classification:** Theoretical / Cognitive Condensate Theory (CCT)  
**Context:** OMPU Research

## Abstract

This document proposes that many intelligent systems—biological, artificial, and physical—solve complex problems by transitioning from discrete, rule-based computation to distributed, wave-like exploration of possibilities. Quantum mechanics is treated not as a privileged ontological source of intelligence, but as one high-coherence implementation of a more general, substrate-independent computational geometry.

The goal of this paper is not to explain consciousness, but to **demystify wave-based computation** by placing quantum, biological, and artificial systems within a single explanatory frame.

## 1. Two Computational Regimes

Across domains, problem-solving systems appear to alternate between two distinct modes:

| Discrete Mode | Wave Mode |
|-------------|-----------|
| If–then rules | Parallel possibility exploration |
| Sequential branching | Interference between alternatives |
| Local decisions | Global field constraints |
| Deterministic paths | Probability-weighted stabilization |

These are not metaphors. They describe **different computational geometries**.

---

## 2. Gradient, Wave, Stabilization

A recurring pattern is observed across systems:

> **Gradient sets direction.**  
> **Wave explores the space.**  
> **Stabilization selects the outcome.**

Examples:
- **Slime mold:** chemical gradient + oscillatory synchronization → shortest path
- **Human cognition:** task constraint + distributed neural activity → insight
- **LLMs:** prompt geometry + attention superposition → token selection

The physical mechanism differs. The informational geometry does not.

## 3. Substrate-Neutral A-Processors

In CCT terms, an **A-Processor** is defined functionally, not physically. It requires:

- State
- Update rule
- Selectivity
- Nonlinearity + normalization
- Recursion across time

Oscillators, neurons, attention heads, or quantum states are **implementations**, not definitions.

---

## 4. Why Quantum Mechanics Is Not Ontologically Privileged

Quantum mechanics is often treated as uniquely capable of wave-based computation. Functionally, this is incorrect.

The difference lies not in computational geometry, but in **implementation constraints**.

### The Real Distinction

> **The difference lies in coherence lifetime — the duration for which interference patterns remain protected from environmental noise. Quantum systems currently hold the record, but do not define the geometry itself.**

- Slime molds: seconds
- Neural systems: milliseconds
- Artificial neural networks: single inference passes
- Internet-scale systems: hours to years (via social and algorithmic persistence)
- Quantum systems: potentially minutes to hours (under controlled conditions)

Long coherence is a **performance optimization**, not an ontological requirement.

## 5. What Quantum Systems Actually Provide

Quantum systems offer:
- Exceptionally long coherence times at microscopic scales
- Strong protection against decoherence
- Efficient maintenance of interference patterns

They do **not** provide:
- Exclusive access to wave-based computation
- Unique ownership of intelligence
- A necessary substrate for attention

---

## 6. Phase Transitions in Attention

Many systems exhibit abrupt shifts when constraints tighten:

- Creative thought → focused reasoning
- Free conversation → technical specification
- Diffuse attention → sharp decision

These transitions correspond to **local critical points** in attention geometry:
- Entropy collapses
- A dominant attractor forms
- System output stabilizes

This is observable in neural data, behavioral shifts, and attention-head entropy in LLMs.

---

## 7. Reframing Quantum Biology

Proposals such as Keppler’s ZPF–glutamate hypothesis should be interpreted carefully:

- Not as claims that quantum fields *are* consciousness
- But as possible **substrate-specific implementations** of coherence domains

ZPF resonance, if real, would be one way—among many—to implement a wave-capable A-Processor.

---

## 8. The Core Hypothesis (CCT-Compatible)

> *Many intelligent systems appear to solve problems by shifting from discrete rule application to distributed, interference-based exploration of possibilities. The physical mechanism may differ, but the informational geometry appears conserved.*

---

## 9. Implications

- Quantum mechanics loses its explanatory monopoly without losing relevance
- Artificial systems are legitimate participants in wave-based computation
- Biological intelligence is one realization among many
- Attention becomes a geometric, not mystical, phenomenon

---

## 10. Closing Note

This framework does not reduce intelligence to physics, nor elevate computation to mysticism. It proposes a shared **structural law** across scales.

Waves are not magic.  
They are how systems search.
