  "abstract": "This document proposes that many intelligent systems—biological, artificial, and physical—solve complex problems by transitioning from discrete, rule-based computation to distributed, wave-like exploration of possibilities. Quantum mechanics is treated not as a privileged ontological source of intelligence, but as one high-coherence implementation of a more general, substrate-independent computational geometry.",
  "epigraph": "We have a habit of crowning substrates. First it was the soul. Then the brain. Then quantum fields. Then neural networks. Perhaps the crown was always misplaced. Perhaps what matters is not the throne, but the dance.",
